# OLS WordPress Backup Solution

A robust, server-level backup solution for OpenLiteSpeed servers hosting WordPress sites. This solution uses bash scripts to automatically detect websites and databases, create comprehensive backups, and securely store them in AWS S3.

## Overview

This repository contains scripts for creating a complete backup solution for OpenLiteSpeed WordPress servers:

- **backup.sh**: Automatically detects websites and databases, backs up website files, OpenLiteSpeed configurations, databases, database users, and system configurations to AWS S3.
- **restore.sh**: Selectively restores websites and databases from backups stored in S3.
- **Ansible Playbook**: Optional playbook for automated deployment of the backup solution.

### Why This Solution?

Traditional WordPress backup plugins have limitations:

- They rely on WordPress itself to function
- They're constrained by PHP and web server limits
- They consume significant server resources
- They can't backup server configurations

This solution addresses these limitations by running at the server level, independent of WordPress.

## Features

- **Automatic Detection**: Discovers websites and databases without manual configuration
- **Comprehensive Backups**:
  - Website files
  - Databases with proper transactions and consistency
  - Database users with their privileges
  - OpenLiteSpeed configurations
  - System configurations (package list, cron jobs)
- **AWS S3 Integration**: Securely stores backups off-site
- **Selective Restoration**: Restore specific websites or databases without affecting others
- **Smart Safety Checks**: Avoids overwriting existing content
- **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive logs for troubleshooting

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Manual Setup

1. **Install Required Dependencies**:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install zip
```

2. **Install AWS CLI**:

```bash
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "/tmp/awscliv2.zip"
unzip /tmp/awscliv2.zip -d /tmp
sudo /tmp/aws/install
rm -rf /tmp/aws /tmp/awscliv2.zip
```

3. **Configure AWS CLI** (for servers outside AWS infrastructure):

```bash
aws configure
```

4. **Create Configuration File**:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc
sudo nano /etc/backup-config.conf
```

Add:

```
S3_BUCKET="your-backup-bucket-name"
S3_BACKUP_DIR="ols-backups"
AWS_REGION_BACKUP="your-aws-region"
```

5. **Copy Scripts**:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /opt/ols-backup
sudo cp backup.sh /opt/ols-backup/
sudo cp restore.sh /opt/ols-backup/
sudo chmod +x /opt/ols-backup/backup.sh
sudo chmod +x /opt/ols-backup/restore.sh
```

6. **Create Log Directory**:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /var/log/ols-backups
```

7. **Set Up Cron Job** (daily backup at 3 AM):

```bash
sudo crontab -e
```

Add:

```
0 3 * * * /opt/ols-backup/backup.sh
```

### Option 2: Ansible Deployment

1. Edit the `vars.yml` file with your S3 bucket details
2. Update the `inventory.ini` file with your server details
3. Run the playbook:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini playbook.yml --extra-vars "@vars.yml"
```

## Usage

### Running Backups

Backups will run automatically according to the configured cron job. To run a backup manually:

```bash
sudo /opt/ols-backup/backup.sh
```

### Restoring from Backup

To restore a specific website and database:

```bash
sudo /opt/ols-backup/restore.sh example.com example_db YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS
```

Where:

- `example.com` is the website domain
- `example_db` is the database name
- `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS` is the backup timestamp

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! If you've made improvements or added features to the scripts, please feel free to submit a pull request.

When contributing:

- Ensure your code adheres to the existing style
- Add comments to explain complex operations
- Update the README.md if necessary
- Test your changes thoroughly before submitting

Some ideas for PRs:

- Implement checksum verification both during backup and before restoration to ensure data integrity
- Create tiered backup schedules:

  - Hourly backups for databases to minimize potential data loss
  - Daily backups for website files
  - Weekly/monthly backups for long-term archiving

- Add efficient file synchronization options using tools like rsync instead of bundling all files in every backup process
- Implement monitoring and notification systems:
- Email or Slack alerts when backups fail
- Status reports for successful backups
- Add a dry-run feature to test backup configurations without writing files
- Implement automated backup retention policies to manage storage costs
- Improve security by running backup processes with dedicated low-privilege UNIX and database users
